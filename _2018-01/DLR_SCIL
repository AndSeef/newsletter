The main objective of the Systems and Control Innovation Lab
(SCIL) is to offer Start-up companies and SMEs direct access to
newest design technologies and software tools in the fields of
system simulation, control and optimization. From the early
design phases on, the physical and dynamical properties of
the hardware and software components are considered and
optimized with a multi-domain, integrated approach.
